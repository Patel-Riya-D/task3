# Task 3 - Linear Regression

This project showcases a complete linear regression pipeline using Python and essential data science libraries. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization, making it a comprehensive example for beginners and intermediate users alike.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

The notebook performs the following steps:

1. **Import Libraries**  
   Essential libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `sklearn` are imported.

2. **Load the Dataset**  
   A dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.

3. **Preprocess the Data**  
   This may include handling missing values, converting data types, or filtering.

5. **Select Feature and Target Variable**  
   Independent (X) and dependent (y) variables are defined for regression.

6. **Split Data into Train/Test Sets**  
   The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

7. **Train the Linear Regression Model**  
   A linear regression model is instantiated and trained on the training data.

8. **Evaluate the Model**  
   Key metrics such as:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - RÂ² Score
   - Adjusted RÂ² Score  
   are computed to evaluate performance.

9. **Visualize the Regression Line**  
   Scatter plots and regression lines are plotted using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

11. **Interpret Model Coefficients**  
   Model coefficients and intercept are interpreted in context of the data.

12. **Residual Plot**  
    A residuals vs fitted plot is drawn to assess model assumptions.

14. **Histogram of Residuals**  
    Distribution of residuals is visualized for checking normality.

16. **Actual vs Predicted Plot**  
    A scatter plot compares actual and predicted values.
